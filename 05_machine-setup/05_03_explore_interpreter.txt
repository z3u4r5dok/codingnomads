Explore the interpreter:

- Execute lines with syntax error and see what the response is.
  - What happens if you leave out a quotation or parenthesis?
  - How helpful are the error messages?

- Use the `help()` function to explore what you can do with the interpreter.
  - For example execute `help('print')`.
  - Press `q` to exit.

print("This is a test not using closed quotation)
The message error is helpful providing a
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)

With the use the help(print) we could visualize the different uses of the print
fucntion.
