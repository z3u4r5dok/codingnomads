# Write code to display the area and perimeter
# of a rectangle that has a width of 2.4 and a height of 6.4.

# Define the dimensions
width = 2.4
height = 6.4

# Calculate area
area = width * height

# Calculate perimeter
perimeter = 2 * (width + height)

# Display the results
print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
print("Peimeter of the rectangle:", perimeter)
